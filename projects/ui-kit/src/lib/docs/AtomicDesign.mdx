# Atomic Design

**Quanta Kit** follows the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology by Brad Frost. This approach helps us build a consistent, modular, and scalable design system.

## The Hierarchy

We structure our components into five distinct levels:

### 1. Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of our user interface. They cannot be broken down any further without ceasing to be functional.

- **Examples**: Buttons, Inputs, Icons, Labels, Color Tokens.
- **Characteristics**: Abstract, not useful on their own, highly reusable.

### 2. Molecules

Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together to be the smallest fundamental units of a compound. They take on their own properties and serve a single function.

- **Examples**: Search Form (Input + Button), User Card (Avatar + Label), Menu Item.
- **Characteristics**: Simple, built for reuse, do one thing well.

### 3. Organisms

Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

- **Examples**: Header (Logo + Nav + Search), Product Grid, Footer.
- **Characteristics**: Complex, distinct section of UI, context-specific.

### 4. Templates

Templates consist of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages. They are mostly concrete but still abstract (wireframes).

- **Examples**: Dashboard Layout, Blog Post Template, Checkout Flow.
- **Characteristics**: Page-level structure, no real content.

### 5. Pages

Pages are specific instances of templates. They show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.

- **Examples**: "User Dashboard", "Homepage", "About Us".
- **Characteristics**: High fidelity, real content, specific instance.

## Directory Structure

Our project structure mirrors this hierarchy:

```
projects/ui-kit/src/lib/
├── atoms/       # Basic components
├── molecules/   # Compound components
├── organisms/   # Complex sections
├── templates/   # Layouts
└── pages/       # Full page examples
```
