# Quanta Kit

**Quanta Kit** is a modern, scalable Angular component library built with **Material Design 3** principles and organized using **Atomic Design** methodology.

## Key Features

- **Angular 18+**: Built with the latest Angular features, including **Signals** and **Standalone Components**.
- **Material Design 3**: Fully compliant with M3 tokens for colors, typography, elevation, and shapes.
- **Atomic Design**: Components are structured logically into Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms for maximum reusability.
- **Theming**: robust light and dark mode support using CSS Custom Properties.
- **Accessibility**: Built-in a11y support following WCAG AA standards.

## Strategies

### Atomic Design

We organize our components to promote modularity and scalability.

- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (Buttons, Inputs, Icons).
- **Molecules**: Groups of atoms (Search Bar, Form Field).
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections (Header, Product Card).
- **Templates**: Page layouts without content.
- **Pages**: Full instances of templates with real content.

### Material Design 3

We utilize the complete M3 token system for a cohesive visual language.

- **Design Tokens**: Comprehensive set of CSS variables for system-wide consistency.
- **Dynamic Color**: Support for color roles (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Error).
- **Elevation & Shape**: Standardized depth and corner radii.
